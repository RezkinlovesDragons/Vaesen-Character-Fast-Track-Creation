The file above is a twine html file; as I have very little knowledge of how to turn it into a functional website outside of my computer. If you know how please comment and help me. The file contains almost all of the information to create a character for the TTRPG Vaesen, a scandinavian horror mystery game. This includes; basic definitions of each archtype, information on skills and attributes, a list of mementos provided by the core rule book, and the age rules. It doesn't include equipment, combat rules or etensive detail on action and mechanics, as there are many cheat sheets for this avaible online for free. Once again I don't own or claim any retail for this website or the game itself, and am just trying to create a more compact character creation for faster and easier gameplay.
